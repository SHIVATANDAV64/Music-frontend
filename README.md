# AUDIO_OS

### High-Fidelity Audio Architecture // Technical Discovery Terminal

**AUDIO_OS** is a precision-engineered music streaming platform designed for audiophiles who value both discovery and personal curation. Built with a "Mechanical Chaos" aesthetic, it bridges the gap between massive global catalogs and private, high-fidelity libraries.

## ─── Core Architecture

- **Engine**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Discovery**: Jamendo Hyper-Stream Protocol (Access to 600k+ Tracks)
- **Persistence**: Appwrite Private Cloud Node (Secure personal uploads & data indexing)
- **Visuals**: Real-time FFT Processing & Canvas-based Mathematical Art
- **Design**: Localized dark-mode isolation for Landing/Auth; System-wide "Peach White" ascetic theme.

## ─── Key Modules

### 01 — THE VOID (Landing)
A high-impact, dark-themed entrance using `MathPeacock` visualizers to demonstrate the intersection of mathematics and sound.

### 02 — AUDIO BLUEPRINT (Dashboard)
The primary interface for library management, featuring the `CymaticsVisualizer` and standard "Peach White" laboratory aesthetic.

### 03 — INGESTION ENGINE (Admin)
Secure terminal for uploading personal audio assets directly to private Appwrite buckets.

## ─── Technical Setup

```bash
# Clone the terminal
git clone <repository-url>

# Initialize dependencies
npm install

# Start the system
npm run dev
```

## ─── System Branding Standard
All modules, metadata, and identity strings must adhere to the `AUDIO_OS` naming convention. 
- **Package ID**: `audio-os`
- **System Version**: 1.0.0
- **Philosophy**: ASCII-sharp precision meets organic frequency.
